The goal is to create a working solar system that follows the laws of physics and is accurate based on the year. It will use NASA's Horizons API to provide precise planetary positions for any date. The application uses WebSockets to show how many other people are online viewing the simulation. It features a 3D interactive view where you can rotate the camera, zoom in and out, and explore the solar system from any angle. There is goin to be react and 3js in the code. 3js helps animations and rendering.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to see what the solar system looks like in real time or what it looked like in the past? It's hard to find a simple and updated 3D solar system visualization on the internet. What if there was a solar system simulator that got accurate information from NASA and conveyed it in a simple format? No complex numbers or confusing charts just visuals. EyesOnSpace.com gives you that simple 3D view of our solar system. Select your date, click play, and watch the solar system flow before your eyes.

### Key features

- Solarsystem Animations
- Cusumizable dates
- 3d movement
- Ambient music

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses 1 Html page that shows all of the features.
- **CSS** - Custom fonts (Eurostile/system-ui), glassmorphism effects, holographic styling, and dark space theme
- **React** -  Interactive 3D solar system view with play/pause controls, date picker spinners, speed controls, planet selection, and real-time orbital animations.
- **Service** - all planetary orbital data validated and sourced from NASA JPL APIs (Horizons System for positions)
- **DB/Login** - User authentication with ability to save and bookmark favorite dates with a usarname.
- **WebSocket** - Real-time presence system showing which users are currently online and viewing the simulation
